# Python Class 02 - Practice Questions

This repository contains simple Python programs designed to practice basic concepts like:
- Taking user input
- String operations
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Mathematical operations (modulus `%` operator)
- Comparison of multiple numbers

---

## Programs Included

### 1. Find Length of User's First Name
- Takes user's first name as input.
- Prints the length of the name.

### 2. Find Occurrence of `$` in a String
- Hardcoded string `"This is my $ pen"`.
- Finds and prints how many times the character `$` appears.

### 3. Grade Assignment Based on Student Marks (First Method)
- Takes student marks as input.
- Assigns grades (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`) based on marks range.
- Displays the corresponding grade.

### 4. Grade Assignment Based on Student Marks (Second Method)
- Another method to assign grades directly using `print()` inside `if-elif` conditions.

### 5. Check if a Number is Odd or Even
- Takes a number as input.
- Checks if the number is even or odd using modulus `%` operator.
- Prints the result.

### 6. Find the Greatest of Three Numbers
- Takes three numbers as input from the user.
- Compares the numbers and prints the greatest one.

### 7. Check if a Number is a Multiple of 7
- Takes a number as input.
- Checks if it is a multiple of 7.
- Prints the result.
